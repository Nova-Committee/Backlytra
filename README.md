# Backlytra

Backports Elytra to 1.8.9. *Fair warning*: this mod is the result of cobbling together code from Quark and vanilla with wild abandon.

Has multiple possible crafting recipes, here they are in order of cost:

**Day One**

**Simple (default)**

**Ridiculous**

The recipe can also be disabled by setting it to **None**, in case you want to add a MineTweaker recipe or some sort of dungeon.

Also includes Quark-like dyeing.
